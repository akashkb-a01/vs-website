Life is full of surprises and questions!! Ever wished you had a manual of life that would help you navigate your way through this big and amazing maze called life?

Then consider your wishes answered because THE BHAGAVAD GITA is hailed as one of the best life manuals ever written and we bring to you a much awaited event THE GITA MAHOTSAV, on the occasion of Gita Jayanti, to explore the scripture and extract meaningful teachings from it.

In the words of Vinoba Bhave, In the Bhagavad Gita, there is no long discussion, nothing elaborate. The main reason for this is that everything stated in the Gita is meant to be tested in the life of every man; it is intended to be verified in practice.

We are hosting a week-long event to unravel the hidden teachings of this great scripture. We will witness talks from personalities who have a deep understanding of Gita followed by a Q/A session where you can ask your doubts. 

The details are as follows:

## An Introduction to Bhagavad Gita

Date: 3rd December

Talk: 6:30 PM to 7:30 PM

Question - Answer session : 7:30 PM to 8:00 PM

Abstract of the Topic:  

Life throws challenges at us quite often. Sometimes we lack courage in facing them and feel depressed or the situation breaks us down. A similar situation occurred in the life of a great hero of India, Arjuna and he also got deluded to choose his right duties amidst a great crisis, which was the famous Mahabharata war. Arjuna was an accomplished and invincible warrior and had experienced intense life in all its aspects. But in the battlefield his mind went into delusion and despondency. Not that he was afraid of fighting or not confident of his skills, but his problem was different. What was his problem, what was his difficulty that ushered his awakening? What type of questions arose in his mind and how were they answered? If his best friend, philosopher, and guide, Sri Krishna, would not help him in this process of evolution, who would? 

Thousands of Arjunas are still facing a similar crisis in their life's journey and the Bhagavad Gita still offers them solutions. It is for us to pay attention to that call and resolve the crisis. Here in this talk, we shall see in detail how Sri Krishna's teachings can help us to face life boldly and joyfully.
