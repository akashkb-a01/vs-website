## ABOUT EKAL VIDYALAYA AND THE TALK
All are cordially welcome to hear the story of The Ekal Vidyalaya Movement which is bringing the light of education to 77,000+ villages located in
all parts of India. The Movement provides five years of free, non-formal
education to children from the age group 6–14 years.
Around half of the students and teachers are females, and about a fifth of
the students go on to pursue higher education, some of which return to
serve the Ekal Foundation.
A typical school has 30 to 40 students taught by a local youth who has
been specifically trained for teaching. A local organizer looks after a
“sub-cluster” of 10 schools. Local people are also involved in the
operations. The entire organizational structure is designed to keep
operational costs as low as possible.
Classes can be held under a tree, or in a hut. Informal modes of teaching
are also used. These include storytelling, folk dramas, folk songs, and
discourses on self-improvement. Along with literacy, Ekal Vidyalaya
schools also impart education in values, hygiene, responding to common
diseases, importance of maternal and child care, and sustainable farming.
The single-teacher school model as run by Ekal Vidyalaya Foundation has
been praised by several state governments and social organizations in
India for its contribution towards literacy and empowerment in rural and
tribal India. Today, the Foundation runs more than 77,000 schools,
teachers 21 lakh students. Till so far, it has positively impacted the
lives of over 10 crore children,
The presenter about the movement will be Dr. A. S. Prasad, Kanpur’s
