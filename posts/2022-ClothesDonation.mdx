May the millions of lamps of Diwali illuminate your life with happiness, joy, peace and health!

Festivals can bring more happiness when there is a sense of collective belonging as a society and when we can bring joy into the lives of others. As an attempt to bring smiles as bright as the lights of Diwali to the underprivileged sections of society, we are organising a clothes donation drive this Diwali for the campus community. You can contribute by donating old clothing, blankets etc. which are no longer in your use. 

This is a donation drive. Kindly make sure the clothes are in usable condition. You can put them in the donation box, which would be in the mess of every hall and ensure that the clothes are folded before putting them into the donation box. 

Date: 23rd and 24th October

Donated clothes would be distributed to orphanages and other underprivileged areas near Kanpur where they are in need.
