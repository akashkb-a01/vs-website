How many times have you felt the need for the ability to sail through all the odds of life courageously and come out as victorious? Are there some aspects of our existence which remain unsatisfied in spite of all our achievements? Is there a way of living which can open the doors of perpetual joy and happiness, everlasting and illimitable?

When one tries to find answers to such questions, one colossal figure who cannot be forgotten is Swami Vivekananda.

This is how Subhash Chandra Bose describes the influence of Swami Vivekananda.

He had such impacts on the lives of countless personalities who were transformed after coming in contact with his thoughts and which enabled them to reach new heights.
