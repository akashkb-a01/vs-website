VS IITK continues to engage faculty members, students and other members of the IITK community in dispensing the message of Swami Vivekananda and in encouraging various kinds of intellectual and inspirational discussions, meditation and Gita sessions. In addition to that, with the help of generous assistance from the IITK authorities and community members over the years, we have also been able to conduct several community service activities, including health camps and eye camps in nearby villages and neighbourhoods around IITK and Kanpur city.

For the past few years, we have been trying our best to distribute clothes during winter (blankets and basic winter garments) to the needy and homeless people in Kanpur city and villages around Kanpur. In the recent past, we have been fortunate to have the Ramakrishna Mission Ashram, Kanpur, collaborating with us in our endeavours. This year, we plan to raise funds to distribute 'kambals', 'woollen caps', and 'socks' to as many people in the city, railway station, and villages as we can within our capacity. We are all aware that winters are severe in all parts of northern India, including Kanpur. Due to the lack of sufficient infrastructural facilities and provisions, many people cannot afford even basic warm clothes, let alone other means of heating. Every year, cities across North India also report several casualties due to extreme weather conditions.

We plan to distribute one 'kambal', one 'woollen cap', and a pair of 'socks' as a complete 'set' to as many people as we can. Each set would cost us in the range of Rs. 350-450. After we have raised sufficient funds in the given time interval, we will buy the required number of such sets. Afterwards, we will distribute them in phases across the city and villages. The tentative date for the first phase of distribution is first week of December 2022.

Without your kind and generous contribution, this entire effort on our part would remain incomplete. We hope you contribute to this collective act of service within your capacity. As part of VS IITK, we will always be grateful to you for this help and for enabling us to continue serving our communities both inside and outside the campus.
