## Speaker Bio
<Quote
  content="My story is not just my story, it's our story — the great Indian story — the story of all things being possible no matter who you are, where you were born and what your parents did; the story of your hard work and dreams and merit dictating your destiny not your inheritance or zip code or family income."

An internationally awarded social entrepreneur known for his work in the field of education and leadership, Sharad Sagar founded Dexterity Global at the early age of 16. Dexterity Global is a national organisation powering the next generation of leaders through educational opportunities and training. Dexterity reaches over 7 million young citizens across remote towns and villages of India. He has several global recognitions on his name.

- He was enlisted in the global Forbes 30 Under 30 list at the age of 24 and was invited by US President Barack Obama to the White House, among other world leaders. 
- Sharad Sagar has won over 200 local, national and international quiz and debate competitions and represented India at intergovernmental and UN platforms. 
- Rockefeller Foundation inducted him into the list of 100 Next Century Innovators. 
- The Nobel Peace Centre invited him to the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony. 
- The queen of England included him in the Queen's Young Leaders list. 
- Sharad Sagar became the first Indian to be elected as the president of the Student Government at the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE). 

If we look at his background, we see that he was from a village in Bihar. He even did not go to school up to the age of 12 years, instead got home schooling from his father. His hard work proved that situations can't stop you; instead, they make you stronger.
